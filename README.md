# Edge of Chaos Cellular Automata
This is an implementation of the Computation At The Edge Of Chaos paper [Langton; 1990]

The main algorithm is implemented with [DirectX11 Compute Shaders](https://github.com/Ne0nWinds/Edge-Of-Chaos-Cellular-Automata/blob/master/win32/advance.compute.hlsl). It's a [basic Win32 app](https://github.com/Ne0nWinds/Edge-Of-Chaos-Cellular-Automata/blob/master/win32/win32.c) written in C
